Case No: 25/78 – The Tragic Death of Pranav Raj

On the night of July 19, 2024, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, witnessed a chilling murder. Pranav Raj, a 20-year-old youth, was found brutally stabbed with an axe at his residence. The initial investigation, led by Swaminathan IPS, quickly revealed that the prime suspect was Kabilesh M, a close acquaintance of Pranav. Motive for the murder remained unclear in the early stages.

The crime scene presented disturbing evidence: the murder weapon—an axe—was discovered near the victim, covered in blood and fingerprints. Investigators immediately collected the fingerprints for analysis, which would later match Kabilesh’s. However, the key to solving the case wasn’t just the physical evidence but the digital trail left behind.

Pranav's mobile phone, recovered at the scene, contained a crucial image file. Investigators believed it held evidence linked to the motive. Using forensic tools, Swaminathan’s team analyzed the file and found an incriminating conversation between Pranav and Kabilesh, suggesting personal conflict had escalated in the days leading up to the murder.

Kabilesh was arrested soon after, and under intense interrogation, he confessed. The motive stemmed from a deep-seated personal grudge. Swaminathan’s efficient investigation and the forensic team's timely efforts led to swift justice for Pranav.

The case highlighted the critical role of both traditional evidence, such as the murder weapon and fingerprints, and modern digital forensics, which helped unravel the hidden motive behind the crime.
